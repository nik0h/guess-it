# Guess It
This was a basic game made to learn the basic concepts of React Native. The player must guess a number between 1 and 10, and it must match up with whatever the next number determined by the app is.

## Usage
After running `npm install`, the Expo server can be started with `expo start` or `npm start` in the project directory. Use the Expo app on an iOS or Android device to connect and use the app.

**Note:** You may need to run `npm install expo -g` to start the Expo server for this project. There may be several errors in the log, as the app was made with an older SDK version than it currently is attached to. New issues introduced were not fixed, but should not affect usage of the app.
